* It's nice to start the talk with a story such as problem statements.
  * "why" and "who"
* Record the video by myself and review it, at least for the first 5mins.
* Not spending so much time on the introduction is generally nice
  * Just to show the context
    * e.g. unittest and coverage
      * What's unittest and coverage
      * Why I need the coverage
* Slide technique
  * スライドなしでトークが成立するくらいが良い
    * Don't put too much texts on the slides
    * e.g.
      * Just key images
      * Just key points
  * Don't rely on the color
  * Dark background is not good
    * -> Editor should be light theme?
  * Live coding
    * Prepare pre-written code
    * Prepare timeline
    * If possible, replace with static code snippets
      * It always breaks
    * Prepare fallback videos
      * Recorded videos are more effective because dead-time can be cut.
  * Do not rely on Internet, fanny image, ...
* How to attend the audiences
  * Asking questions and for raising hands is one option but gray area
* If no one asks questions in the Q&A time, add some talks to answer potential questions and say "please ask me later".
* If you can't answer the question, say "send it me later via email" or "can we discuss it after the talk? sorry I can't listen as English is not my first language."

## Feedback
* スクリーンか画面を見て喋ってる感じがする。もっと聴衆を見て話しかける感じで。目線と抑揚。
